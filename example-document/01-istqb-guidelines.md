This chapter explains rules on writing content for ISTQB® syllabus and other documents.

## Guidelines for Syllabus Authoring and Technical Reviewing

A curriculum is a list of topics and areas of knowledge that must be learned, mastered or studied. A curriculum is not a textbook or teaching material. For this reason, this checklist has been developed with general technical, written guidelines.

Goals of this checklist are:

1. To make the syllabus easy to read and understand for people all over the world
2. To improve the Learnability of the content of the syllabus
3. To make the syllabus easily translatable into different languages

Texts that are easy and difficult to understand differ in several individual features. The Hamburg concept of intelligibility summarizes them in four groups. They are called "intelligibility features". They are called simplicity, structure / order, brevity / conciseness and stimulating additions.

1. **Simplicity**: The author uses common words that every reader knows, preferably concrete, clear, "living" words. If unusual expressions cannot be avoided, they are explained. The sentences are short. Subordinate clauses come before or after main clauses, not in the middle.

2. **Structure / order**: At the beginning, the author makes it clear what it is about. He puts the individual points of view in a meaningful order and clarifies how the sentences relate to one another. This internal order of the text is reflected in the external structure - through paragraphs, subheadings, emphasis, and summaries.

3. **Shortness / conciseness**: In the case of extreme brevity / conciseness, every word is necessary. The opposite is dissipation. Best for clarity: short, but not extremely short. A little redundancy, in other words the same thing again, is welcome.

4. **Stimulating additions**: The author uses small ingredients that bring the facts to life, encourage reading pleasure, keep the reader engaged - even if the content may not be that exciting. But this is done sparingly so that the essentials are not lost in the accessories.

## Intelligibility features checklists

The following Checklists supports the four above "intelligibility features":

1. The numbered sections of the syllabus have a maximum of 3 levels as defined below:  
    a. Chapter number Chapter name,  
    b. X.Y Section name,  
    c. X.Y.Z - Sub section name  

    Note: To ensure consistency, it is important to follow the rules regarding what information should go in a chapter or in an appendix.

    Chapters with numbers: all content of the syllabus and all supportive content for the syllabus (Bibliography, List of abbreviations, Non-testing terms, etc.)
    Appendices: all extended content not directly connected to reading a syllabus like (K-Levels, Traceability matrix, Release notes, etc.).

1. Readability must not be higher than an 8ˆthˆ grade student. Measure the readability of the syllabus, goal is level for an 8th grade student to read and understand the text.
1. Whenever possible use active voice instead of passive voice
1. Hyphenations must be correct
1. Avoid using compound sentences
1. Be aware of specific words that can cause interpretation problems (e.g. when using words such as “often, always, common”)
1. Use the Bloom’s Taxonomy when writing Learning Objectives. Refer to https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/
1. Avoid using abbreviations. If an abbreviation/acronym is used for a phrase, then it shall be defined the first time it is mentioned in the syllabus next to the phrase, and the abbreviation/acronym continues to be used throughout the remainder of the Syllabus and not the phrase. Keywords are not to be abbreviated in the keyword section, it should list only the term. The only exception is that the phrase can be used in Chapter titles and section headings followed by the abbreviation/acronym.  
The above rule applies to all Chapters in the Syllabus starting with Chapter 0 (i.e. If an abbreviation/acronym is defined for a phrase in Chapter 0, then the abbreviation can be used in the remaining chapters).
Abbreviations of glossary terms must be the same as in the glossary. For example, if the syllabus uses an abbreviation for the glossary term “behavior-driven development”, then it must be “BDD” like in the glossary.
1. If there are many abbreviations/acronyms, then an abbreviation table should be created as an Appendix with the heading “List of Abbreviations” and all the abbreviations/acronyms should be listed in alphabetical order.
1. A word or phrase cannot be described by more than one term.  There must only be one term for each word defined.
1. The draft version of the syllabus must include line numbering. To enable line numbering uncomment two line sof code in *Linenumbers* section in `syllabus.tex` document.
1. The Syllabus shall refrain from using synonyms for an existing ISTQB® Glossary term. 
1. The wording in a Syllabus should avoid using examples that may become outdated such as examples of tools.
1. Refrain from using personal pronouns (i.e. I, you, we, they) to keep the syllabus in a formal written style. However, if it is important to use personal pronouns, choose the third person plural instead of singular to ensure we adhere to gender neutral language.
1. Redundant text must be removed from the Syllabus.
1. The wording in the Syllabus must be written in a consistent manner.
1. All wording must be written in US English.
1. The Syllabus shall not contain definitions for terms that are in the ISTQB® Glossary.
1. Every sub-section shall correspond to one learning objective.  
No content shall be added without a reference to a learning objective except for content in introduction sections.
1. Each Learning Objective should be atomic in nature.
1. Guidance on text describing a learning objective shall follow the rules:
    
    | K-level | Words | Non-Blank Chars |
    |--------:|------:|--------:|
    | 1       |  200  | 1000 |
    | 2       |  300  | 1500 |
    | 3       |  500  | 2500 |
    | 4       |  600  | 3000 |
    | 5       |  900  | 4500 |
    | 6       | 1000  | 5000 |
    
    Normal size +/-20% shall be accepted; authors shall justify deviations to the Product Owner.
1. The number of the Learning Objective and the K levels and their time allocated for the section must match: 

    * K1 15 minutes or less 
    * K2 15 minutes 
    * K3 60 minutes 
    * K4 75 minutes 
    * K5 and K6 90 minutes
1. Domain-specific non-testing terms of major importance should have a definition in the Syllabus. Depending on their number, they may be defined in-line or in an appendix of Domain-specific terms. Definitions for domain-specific terms shall follow the same principles as definitions in the ISTQB® Glossary.

    1. these are examinable and therefore appear in the Domain-specific Keywords section below the Keywords in each chapter.
    2. They do not appear in the Glossary.
    3. Although these terms will appear in an appendix, they are examinable as long as they appear in a chapter under the heading Domain-specific Keywords.
1. Run the spelling and grammar check against the document. 
1. Title guidelines: All words in a title should be capitalized except for articles (i.e. a, an, the), conjunctions of less than four letters (i.e. and, or, but, nor, yet, so) and prepositions of less than four letters (in, to, of, at, by, for, off, on, up)
1. Bulleting and numbering guidelines: Numbered lists are usually used when you need to put the headings under a specific order, ascending or descending. However, bullet points are used to get across your stuff fully in rather a chronological order without emphasis on any one point particularly.
